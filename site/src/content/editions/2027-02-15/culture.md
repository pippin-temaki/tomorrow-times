**MILAN** — The Milano Cortina Winter Olympics opened last Saturday with a dazzling ceremony blending Italian opera, alpine imagery, and cutting-edge augmented reality technology that projected holographic performers across the night sky. But the spectacle could not obscure the mounting questions about whether winter sports have a sustainable future in an era of accelerating climate change.

This year's Games, held across venues in Milan and the Italian Alps, have faced unprecedented weather challenges. Unseasonably warm temperatures forced organizers to transport snow from higher elevations for several events. Two training runs had to be canceled when temperatures exceeded 50°F at alpine venues designed for well-below-freezing conditions.

"We are racing against the calendar and the thermometer," said Giovanni Malagò, president of the Italian Olympic Committee, in remarks that captured the existential anxiety hanging over the Games. "This may be one of the last Winter Olympics as we know them."

## A Warming Problem for Winter Sports

The crisis facing winter sports is no longer theoretical. A study published last month in *Nature Climate Change* found that of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics since 1924, only 10 would be reliably cold enough to host again by 2050 under current warming trajectories. By 2080, that number drops to three: Sapporo, Japan; Calgary, Canada; and possibly Oslo, Norway.

"The Winter Olympics are becoming a victim of the climate crisis they have partially contributed to," said Dr. Robert Steiger, a climate researcher at the University of Innsbruck who specializes in winter sports. "The irony is devastating. Flying athletes and spectators around the world, building massive infrastructure—it all adds to the warming that makes the events impossible."

The International Olympic Committee has acknowledged the challenge, setting ambitious carbon neutrality targets and exploring alternatives like indoor snow sports or relocating events to more reliably cold regions. But neither solution addresses the fundamental question: can winter sports survive as mainstream athletic competition?

Freestyle skier Eileen Gu, competing in her second Olympics for China, put it starkly in a press conference: "I learned to ski on artificial snow in China. My kids might only ever ski on artificial snow. Is that still skiing? I don't know."

## The AI Cheating Scandal

Climate concerns have competed for attention with a more immediate controversy: allegations of AI-assisted performance enhancement in figure skating.

Russian skater Anastasia Volkov's gold medal performance in the women's free skate was immediately questioned after analysts noted her jump rotation speeds exceeded what biomechanics models suggest is humanly possible without assistance.

Subsequent investigation revealed that Volkov had been training with an AI coaching system developed by a Russian sports tech firm. The system, using real-time motion capture and neural network analysis, provided micro-corrections to her technique between elements—essentially giving her a computational advantage over competitors relying solely on human coaching.

"This is not coaching. This is enhancement," argued U.S. Figure Skating president Pat St. Peter. "It's no different than mechanical doping in cycling. The athlete's performance is being augmented by technology during competition."

The International Skating Union's current regulations prohibit electronic communication with athletes during performances but don't explicitly address AI systems that athletes have internalized through training. A emergency session to clarify rules ended in deadlock, with some nations arguing for broad AI bans and others (notably Russia and China) contending that all modern coaching incorporates computational analysis.

"Where do you draw the line?" asked Chinese Olympic official Li Wei. "Video analysis is computational. Biomechanics research is computational. Is using any data-driven insight now cheating? This is absurd."

The controversy mirrors broader debates about AI in sports, from baseball's pitch-framing algorithms to basketball's shot selection optimization. As AI capabilities advance, the line between coaching tool and performance enhancer grows increasingly blurred.

## The Streaming Wars Come to Sports

Off the slopes and rinks, the Olympics are also serving as a battlefield in the escalating streaming wars. For the first time, no single U.S. broadcaster holds exclusive Olympics rights. Instead, NBCUniversal, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ are all streaming different events simultaneously, fragmenting viewership and confusing consumers.

"I need three subscriptions to watch sports my parents got on one channel for free," complained Alex Martinez, a 28-year-old viewer from Los Angeles who expressed frustration shared by millions on social media. "This isn't more choice. It's extortion."

Early viewership numbers suggest significant audience erosion compared to previous Olympics. The opening ceremony drew 22 million U.S. viewers across all platforms—down 35% from the 2022 Beijing Games and 48% from PyeongChang in 2018.

"The fragmentation is killing the cultural moment," said Brian Fuentes, a sports media analyst at Ampere Analysis. "The Olympics used to be something everyone watched together. Now it's something different people watch on different platforms at different times. You lose the shared experience that made the Olympics special."

International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach defended the multi-platform approach, arguing it maximizes revenue and reaches younger viewers who have abandoned traditional television. But internal IOC documents leaked to *Sports Business Journal* show significant concern about long-term brand erosion.

## Geopolitics Intrude (Again)

Politics, never far from the Olympics, also cast a shadow over Milano Cortina. Russia and Belarus athletes are competing under neutral flags as sanctions for the Ukraine war continue. Several Ukrainian athletes withdrew in protest, saying they couldn't compete alongside "representatives of a terrorist state."

The decision by the IOC to allow Russian and Belarusian participation under restrictions drew sharp criticism from Western governments but was defended as preserving the Olympic ideal of separating sports and politics.

"We are seeing the same cowardice we saw with Nazi Germany in 1936," said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a statement. "There is no neutral ground in a war of aggression. The IOC's both-sidesism enables war crimes."

Chinese human rights concerns also resurfaced, with advocacy groups staging protests in Milan over the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. The protests were largely peaceful but briefly disrupted the torch relay.

## Moments of Grace Amid Chaos

Despite controversies, the Games have produced spectacular athletic achievements. Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Høsflot Klæbo captured his record 15th Olympic medal, cementing his status as perhaps the greatest winter Olympian of all time.

American snowboarder Chloe Kim, now 26, won her third consecutive halfpipe gold, a feat unmatched in the sport's Olympic history. In her post-event interview, Kim announced she would retire from competition to focus on mental health advocacy—a move widely praised given the sport's grueling demands.

"I've given everything to this sport," Kim said, tears streaming down her face. "Now I want to give something to myself. And to other young athletes struggling with the pressure we all face. There's life after gold medals. I want to help people find it."

The closing ceremony is scheduled for next Sunday. Organizers promise a celebration of winter sports' past and an optimistic vision of its future. But as temperatures in Milan reached 55°F today—unprecedented for mid-February—optimism feels as fragile as the transported snow melting under the alpine sun.

"We have maybe two more Winter Olympic cycles before the model becomes unsustainable," said Dr. Steiger, the climate researcher. "After that, we're either talking about indoor winter sports, summer-only Olympics, or we're talking about the end of an era."

For athletes who have dedicated their lives to sports practiced on snow and ice, the clock isn't just running. It's melting.
