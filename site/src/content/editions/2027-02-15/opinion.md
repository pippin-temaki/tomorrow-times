Welcome to The Tomorrow Times. You are reading a newspaper from the future—specifically, from exactly one year ahead of whenever you're reading this. Every article, every headline, every prediction represents our best estimate of what February 15, 2027 will look like when it arrives.

We should be clear about something from the start: **most of what you just read is probably wrong.**

Not in the sense of fiction or fabrication—we've worked hard to ground every prediction in current trends, expert analysis, and probabilistic reasoning. But wrong in the sense that the future rarely unfolds precisely as anticipated, even by experts armed with sophisticated models and decades of experience.

Philip Tetlock's landmark research on forecasting, spanning 20 years and 28,000 predictions, found that even domain experts perform only marginally better than random chance when predicting complex geopolitical and economic events. The average expert's Brier score—a metric where 0 is perfect accuracy and 1 is perfect inaccuracy—hovers around 0.40. That's only slightly better than the 0.50 you'd get from a coin flip.

The top 2% of forecasters—Tetlock's famous "superforecasters"—achieve Brier scores around 0.20. Impressive, certainly. But still wrong 20% of the time on binary yes/no questions, and often wrong in more complex predictions where multiple outcomes are possible.

So why do this? If prediction is so difficult, and failure so likely, why publish a newspaper full of forecasts we know will largely miss the mark?

## Because Forecasting Forces Better Thinking

The exercise of structured forecasting—assigning probabilities, articulating reasoning, considering alternative scenarios—produces clearer thinking even when the final prediction fails.

When we write that the Senate will pass AI regulation with 60% confidence, we're forced to articulate *why*: what political incentives favor passage, what obstacles exist, what historical precedents are relevant. That analysis has value even if the final outcome differs.

When we predict the S&P 500 will reach 7,000, we must grapple with monetary policy trajectory, earnings estimates, geopolitical risks, and valuation metrics. The prediction's accuracy matters less than the thinking it requires.

"Strong opinions, weakly held" is a popular Silicon Valley maxim. Forecasting is its practical application: committing to a specific prediction while remaining open to contrary evidence.

## Because Accountability Matters

A year from now—on the *actual* February 15, 2027—we will publish our accuracy report. We will calculate our Brier scores. We will list the predictions that were prescient, the ones that were laughably wrong, and everything in between.

This is journalism with a built-in reckoning. Political pundits can claim vindication regardless of outcomes, selectively remembering hits and forgetting misses. Market forecasters can quietly revise predictions when convenient. But we're creating a permanent record, time-stamped and immutable.

If we predict war and there's peace, you'll know. If we predict economic boom and there's recession, we can't hide. Accountability focuses the mind wonderfully.

## Because the Future Isn't Fixed

One subtle truth about prediction: the act of predicting can change the outcome. Economists call this reflexivity.

If enough people read our article about quantum computing threats to encryption and take action—migrating to post-quantum cryptography, investing in quantum-resistant infrastructure—they collectively reduce the risk we're predicting. The prediction becomes less accurate *because* it was made.

Conversely, if our optimistic AI regulation prediction creates complacency among safety advocates, their reduced activism could make passage less likely.

George Soros, who built a fortune on understanding reflexivity in financial markets, put it well: "The participants' perceptions influence the situation to which they relate. This influence takes the form of a two-way feedback mechanism."

Predictions aren't observations of a fixed future. They're interventions in a fluid present.

## The Categories We'll Get Wrong

Some types of predictions are reliably more difficult than others. Based on Tetlock's research and our own analysis, here's what we're most likely to miss:

**Discontinuous events**: Black swans, by definition, aren't predictable. A pandemic, a sudden war, a breakthrough technology, an assassination, a financial crisis—these reshape the landscape in ways linear extrapolation can't capture. We've tried to account for tail risks, but by nature, the most consequential unexpected events are precisely those we haven't imagined.

**Timing**: We might be right about the *what* but wrong about the *when*. Fusion power will be commercially viable... someday. AI will achieve AGI... eventually. Predicting whether these arrive in 2027, 2037, or 2077 is extraordinarily difficult. Trends are easier to forecast than inflection points.

**Second-order effects**: We can reasonably predict AI capabilities will continue advancing. We're less confident about how that affects labor markets, which depends on regulation, adoption rates, economic conditions, and social factors that themselves depend on other predictions. Each dependency compounds uncertainty.

**Political outcomes**: Elections, legislation, international negotiations—these involve strategic actors making decisions in response to each other in contexts that shift rapidly. They're among the hardest things to predict. We've done it anyway, because they matter, but expect high error rates.

## What We'll Probably Get Right

Some predictions are more reliable:

**Technological trajectories** (in the near term): Moore's Law has slowed, but capability advancement in AI, quantum computing, and biotech follows relatively predictable curves over 1-2 year windows.

**Demographic trends**: Populations don't change quickly. Aging societies, urbanization, migration patterns—these evolve slowly and predictably.

**Climate and environmental trends**: Greenhouse gas concentrations, temperature anomalies, sea-level rise—the physics is well understood, and while year-to-year variation occurs, multi-year trends are robust.

**Economic aggregates** (with caveats): GDP growth, inflation, unemployment—these mean-revert over time. Predicting the business cycle is hard, but predicting that growth will be between 1-4% is easier. We won't catch recessions reliably, but we'll be in the right ballpark most years.

## How to Read This Newspaper

We've included confidence levels on every article: 🟢 **High** | 🟡 **Medium** | 🔴 **Speculative**

High confidence doesn't mean certainty—it means roughly 70-80% probability we're directionally correct. Medium is 50-70%. Speculative is under 50%—we're publishing it because it's interesting and plausible, not because we think it's likely.

We've also included "Prediction Basis" sections explaining our reasoning. These are intentionally transparent. If you disagree with our assumptions, you should discount the conclusions.

Treat this newspaper as a scenario planning exercise, not a crystal ball. The value isn't in getting the exact future right—it's in expanding the range of futures you've seriously considered.

As the statistician George Box observed: "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

All predictions are wrong. But some predictions are useful.

We aim to be useful. And exactly one year from now, we'll know if we succeeded.

Until then, the future awaits—uncertain, probabilistic, and endlessly fascinating.
