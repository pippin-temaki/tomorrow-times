# Will populate as arcs conclude

arc_management_notes: |
  - Active arcs should drive 40-60% of front-page stories
  - Building arcs get occasional coverage (1-2x per week)
  - When arc resolves, do a major "The Story So Far" recap
  - Aim for 3-5 active arcs at any time
  - Rotate in new arcs as old ones resolve
  - Arcs can be domestic, international, scientific, cultural
  - High tension arcs get more coverage
  - Connect arcs when logical (e.g., AI regulation affects AI agent economy)
